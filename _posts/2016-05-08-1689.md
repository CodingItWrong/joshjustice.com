[A Tabular Comparison](http://www.proginosko.com/docs/wcf_lbcf.html)

* 3.7: Westminster includes a paragraph about reprobation that is more suggestive of supralapsarianism.
* 7.2: Westminster explicitly names the so-called covenant of works. Both name the covenant of grace.
* 7.3: London states the covenant of redemption, but not by name.
* 19.1: Westminster says "covenant of works," London says "a law of universal obedience."
